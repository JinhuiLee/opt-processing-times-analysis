    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Students under the F-1 visa usually apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) to get work authorization from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for internships / jobs. It is also the ultimate test of one's patience. Even after one has braved the inane paperworks and countless trips to advisors / international student offices, one would still have to wait up to 90 days for the authorization approval. **What makes this wait worse is the lack of updates during the wait.** When one applies for OPT (and the application is received by USCIS), one gets a receipt number. Using this receipt number to check one's progress (at [https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/mycasestatus.do](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/mycasestatus.do)) is highly unsatisfying. Until the work authorization is approved (or God forbid rejected / put on hold for additional evidence), one is faced with rather useless description that reads something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 'On February 22, 2016, we received your Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization , Receipt Number EAC1690120079, and sent you the receipt notice that describes how we will process your case. Please follow the instructions in the notice. If you do not receive your receipt notice by March 23, 2016, please call Customer Service at 1-800-375-5283. If you move, go to www.uscis.gov/addresschange to give us your new mailing address.'\n",
    "\n",
    "USCIS does a really bad job of keeping one updated on the progress of a case and in general how far along they are going with the entire year's batch of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fortunately, we can do better.**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Receipt Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "USCIS issues receipt numbers in chronological order. That means if I submitted my application on March 1, 2016 and I got the number YSC1690079958, the next person to submit his application gets the number YSC169007995**9**. The person before me gets the number YSC169007995**7**. Using this fact, I can see how people before and after me are doing. USCIS also states that the cases are processed in a first-come-first-serve order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a huge proportion of people before (and possibly after) me have their OPTs approved, I should have mine processed soon.\n",
    "- However, if the people who submitted around my date are stil waiting for their approval, I can expect to wait a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, doing so manually at [https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/mycasestatus.do](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/mycasestatus.do) is a slow and tiring process. Instead, I can write a script to \"scrape\" the website for the 50,000 or so cases before and after my own number.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Additional note: This year, there are two USCIS centers processing OPT applications -- the Vermont office and the Potomac office. The Potomac office opened later in the cycle (around March) to help with the application volume. [https://www.uscis.gov/news/potomac-service-center-now-processing-certain-form-i-765-cases](https://www.uscis.gov/news/potomac-service-center-now-processing-certain-form-i-765-cases). Applications that are sent to the Vermont office first have the prefix `EAC`. Those may be then routed to the Potomac office. Applications that are sent in late March and later are sent directly to the Potomac office, giving them the prefix `YSC`. This means that when I scrape the pages for data, I have to account for both prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I planned to scrape receipt numbers `EAC1690120000` to `EAC1690180000` and `YSC1690040000` to `YSC1690080000`. This should give me a good sense of applications submitted in the February to April period.\n",

    "USCIS (unsurprisingly) blocked my IP after around 2,000 queries. So I needed a way to get around the IP blocking. Fortunately, an easy solution was available: [http://scrapoxy.io/](http://scrapoxy.io/). Scrapoxy manages a pool of EC2 / DigitalOcean instances for you (afte some setting up) and provides a single local port for you as a proxy. This allows you to route your requests through the multiple cloud instances. This lowers the likelihood of a single IP getting blocked. (Even if one gets blocked, you can simply kill the instance and restart it. I didn't have to do this, sine none of the cloud instances got blocked). After setting up Scrapoxy and running the proxy at `http://localhost:8888`, I can pass this easily to the `request` module in my script:\n",

For the others (approved or rejected) the case status `text` only contains the date that the case was approved (which I am really not interested in for now). I want to know when those cases are **submitted**. Fortunately, I can again exploit the fact that the numbers are in increasing order. When the date of a case cannot be determined, I simply look backwards (to earlier receipt numbers) to the last known date of a still processing case. This gives me a good approximation of the submission dates of approved / rejected cases."
